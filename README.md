# Tasklist-JS

## Description

When I am organizing projects, I often want to break them down into subtasks or distribute tasks between multiple categories. This is why I love to use sticky notes, because I can use one note per task, and break each one down into its subtasks on the note. I have been on a quest to create an organizer that allows me to organize my tasks on a computer the way I do on sticky notes.

My first attempt at an organizer was my project "Tasklist," which accomplished much of my vision, but required a full-page reload for every action. My goal in Tasklist-JS was to create a lighter-weight organzier using JavaScript event handlers for client-side interactivity.

Future updates may include improved styling, integration with a database to store lists for future access, reorder cards and tasks, and the ability to edit text or strikethrough a task or card instead of deleting them.
