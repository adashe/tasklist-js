# Tasklist-JS

## Description

When I am organizing projects, I often want to break them down into subtasks or distribute tasks between multiple people or categories. This is why I love to use sticky notes, because I can use one note per task, and break each one down into its subtasks on the note. I have been on a quest to create a task organizer that allows me to organize my tasks on a computer the way I do on sticky notes.

My first attempt at a task organizer was my project "Tasklist," which accomplished much of my vision, but had a clunky user interface and functionality. My goal in Tasklist-JS was to create a lighter-weight task organzier with a smoother UI/UX using JavaScript event handlers.

Future updates may include fancier styling, integration with a database to store projects for future access, and the ability to edit text or strikethrough a task or card instead of deleting them.
